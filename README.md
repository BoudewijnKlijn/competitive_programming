# Project Euler

This repo contains my solutions for a number of problems on https://projecteuler.net/. 

Project Euler is a great way to learn new programming languages or at least that's what I used it for. I have not solved any problems recently; most solutions date from 2014-2019.

## Languages

- C
- Matlab
- Python
